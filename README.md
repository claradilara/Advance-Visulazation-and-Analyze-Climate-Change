# Advanced Data Visualization in R – Shiny Sentiment Analysis Dashboard

This project was developed as part of an **Advanced Data Visualization in R**
course. It presents an **interactive Shiny dashboard** for exploring and
analyzing **sentiment analysis results** through multiple visualizations.

The goal of the project is to demonstrate how complex analytical results can be
communicated effectively using interactive visual tools.

---

## Project Overview
The dashboard allows users to:
- Explore sentiment distributions (positive, negative, neutral)
- Compare sentiment across categories or time
- Interact with visual elements to gain insights dynamically
- Understand sentiment patterns through multiple plot types

The project emphasizes **clarity, interactivity, and storytelling through data**.

## Data & Sentiment Analysis
- Text data is preprocessed and analyzed for sentiment
- Sentiment scores are calculated using a lexicon-based or preprocessed approach
- Each observation is assigned a sentiment category
- Aggregated sentiment metrics are used for visualization

---

## Visualizations Included
The Shiny dashboard includes several interactive plots, such as:
- Sentiment distribution bar charts
- Time-based sentiment trends
- Comparative sentiment plots across groups
- Summary statistics and key indicators

All visualizations are reactive and update dynamically based on user input.
